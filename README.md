## Law

It is noteworthy that, in 1990, Brazilian legislation established the obligation of private companies, from one hundred (100) employees to fill a portion of their positions with people with disabilities. This obligation is also known as the Quota Law (Article 93 of Law No. 8.213/90). 

The legal reserve of the quota depends on the general number of employees that the company has in its staff, in the following proportion, as established by art. 93 of Law No. 8.213/90:

| Number of employs | Percentage of |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| 100-200           | 2%            |
| 201-500           | 3%            |
| 501-1000          | 4%            |
| 1001 or more      | 5%            |
